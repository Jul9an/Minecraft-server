#At first you have to add Java to your Rpi.
#Go to the command line type

sudo apt search 

#Wait untill its installed

sudo apt install openjdk-9-jdk-headless

#Control your java version

java -version

#Create a file in /home/pi to save your server data 

mkdir mcserver
cd mcserver

#Get the minecraft server data in a usual browser (https://www.minecraft.net/de-de/download/server). Copy the link adress and paste it into the command line:

wget "paste link adress here"

#To set the server up type:

java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar server.jar nogui

#With -Xmx and -Xms you can limit the RAM usage. But you should choose at least 1GB. After this you have to accept the EULA.

nano eula.txt
eula=true

#After accepting the eula you have to start the server again.

java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar server.jar nogui

#Then you should be able to join the Server if your PC and the Rpi are in the same Network.
