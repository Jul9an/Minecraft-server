#At first you have to add Java to your Rpi.
#Go to the command line type

sudo apt search 

#Wait untill its installed

sudo apt install openjdk-9-jdk-headless

#Control your java version

java -version

#Create a file in /home/pi to save your server data 

mkdir mcserver
cd mcserver

#Get the minecraft server data in a usual browser (https://www.minecraft.net/de-de/download/server). Copy the link adress and paste it into the command line:

wget "paste link adress here"

#To set the server up type:

java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar server.jar nogui

#After this you have to accept the EULA.

nano eula.txt
eula=true

#After accepting the eula you have to start the server again.

java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar server.jar nogui
#Then you should be able to join the server over his IP, as long as your PC and the Pi are in the same network.

#If you want to see the use of RAM for example you just have to write the command without nogui. Then you will see "statistics" of your used RAM and the server log.
#With -Xmx and -Xms you can limit the RAM usage. But you should choose at least 1GB or more if you have a Pi4 or better.
